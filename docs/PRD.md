Product Requirements Document: Automated Cryptocurrency Arbitrage Bot
Version: 2.4
Date: January 28, 2025
Status: Enhanced - Hybrid Trading Platform with Clarified Architecture

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for an advanced hybrid cryptocurrency trading platform that combines arbitrage detection with technical analysis trading opportunities. The system provides a sophisticated market alert/opportunity system with two core components: **arbitrage opportunities** (requiring 2 positions: long + short) and **technical analysis opportunities** (requiring 1 position), delivered through a secure global opportunity system using read-only admin APIs with user access control based on RBAC and API compatibility.

1.2 Product Vision
To develop a comprehensive trading platform that delivers market opportunities through:
- **Global Opportunity System**: Centralized opportunity detection using super admin read-only APIs
- **User API Validation**: Ensure users have compatible exchange APIs before accessing trading features
- **Dual Opportunity Types**: Arbitrage (2-position: long/short) and Technical Analysis (1-position)
- **Tiered Access Model**: Free users (limited), Free+API users (enhanced), Subscription users (unlimited)
- **AI Integration**: Global opportunity analysis + personal opportunity generation for different exchanges
- **Group/Channel Support**: Enhanced limits for group/channel contexts with future subscription model

1.3 Market Alert/Opportunity Architecture

## **Core Components**

### **1. Global Opportunity System**
- **Data Source**: Super admin provides read-only exchange API keys for market data
- **Supported Exchanges**: Only exchanges where we have read-only API access (e.g., Binance, Bybit, OKX)
- **Security**: Read-only APIs cannot execute trades, only fetch market data
- **Opportunity Generation**: System generates opportunities using admin's read-only market access

### **2. Opportunity Types & Position Structure**

**Arbitrage Opportunities** (2 Positions Required):
```rust
pub struct ArbitrageOpportunity {
    pub long_exchange: ExchangeId,    // Required: Exchange for long position
    pub short_exchange: ExchangeId,   // Required: Exchange for short position
    pub long_position: Position,      // Required: Long position details
    pub short_position: Position,     // Required: Short position details
    pub funding_rate_diff: f64,       // Rate difference between exchanges
    pub min_exchanges_required: 2,    // Always 2 for arbitrage
}
```

**Technical Analysis Opportunities** (1 Position Required):
```rust
pub struct TechnicalOpportunity {
    pub exchange: ExchangeId,         // Required: Single exchange
    pub position: Position,           // Required: Single position (buy/sell)
    pub technical_signals: Vec<Signal>, // RSI, MACD, etc.
    pub min_exchanges_required: 1,    // Always 1 for technical
}
```

### **3. User Access Control & API Validation**

**User Access Levels**:
```rust
pub enum UserAccessLevel {
    FreeWithoutAPI {
        daily_limit: 3,
        delay_minutes: 5,
        can_trade: false,
    },
    FreeWithAPI {
        arbitrage_daily: 10,
        technical_daily: 10,
        delay_minutes: 0,
        can_trade: true,
        requires_api_validation: true,
    },
    SubscriptionWithAPI {
        unlimited_opportunities: true,
        automation_enabled: bool,
        can_trade: true,
        requires_api_validation: true,
    },
}
```

**API Validation Requirements**:
- **Arbitrage**: User must have API keys for BOTH exchanges in the opportunity
- **Technical**: User must have API key for the ONE exchange in the opportunity
- **No API**: User cannot access trading features, only view delayed opportunities
- **Different Platform**: If user's APIs don't match global opportunities, generate personal opportunities

### **4. Personal Opportunity System**
When user has exchange APIs that differ from global opportunity exchanges:
```rust
pub struct PersonalOpportunityService {
    // Generate opportunities using user's personal exchange APIs
    async fn generate_personal_arbitrage(&self, user_exchanges: Vec<ExchangeId>) -> Vec<ArbitrageOpportunity>;
    async fn generate_personal_technical(&self, user_exchanges: Vec<ExchangeId>) -> Vec<TechnicalOpportunity>;
    
    // Hybrid: Combine global + personal opportunities
    async fn generate_hybrid_opportunities(&self, user_id: &str) -> Vec<Opportunity>;
}
```

### **5. AI Integration Architecture**

**AI Analysis Types**:
```rust
pub enum AIAnalysisType {
    GlobalOpportunityAnalysis {
        opportunity: GlobalOpportunity,
        template: AITemplate,           // Default or user-customized
        user_config: Option<UserAIConfig>,
    },
    PersonalOpportunityAnalysis {
        user_exchanges: Vec<ExchangeId>,
        template: AITemplate,
        user_config: UserAIConfig,      // Required for personal analysis
    },
}
```

**AI Configuration**:
- **Default Templates**: System provides default AI analysis templates
- **User Configuration**: Users can customize AI analysis parameters
- **Global + AI Enhancement**: AI analyzes global opportunities using user's configuration
- **Personal AI Generation**: AI generates opportunities using user's exchange APIs when different from global

### **6. Group/Channel Subscription Model**

**Current Implementation** (Free tier with multiplier):
```rust
pub enum ChatContext {
    Private { user_access: UserAccessLevel },
    Group { 
        daily_multiplier: 2.0,          // Double the free user limits
        arbitrage_daily: 6,             // 3 * 2
        technical_daily: 6,             // 3 * 2
        delay_minutes: 5,
    },
    Channel { 
        daily_multiplier: 2.0,
        arbitrage_daily: 6,
        technical_daily: 6,
        delay_minutes: 5,
    },
}
```

**Future Group Subscription Tiers**:
- **Free Group**: 6 opportunities daily (3 * 2), 5-minute delay
- **Premium Group** ($99/month): 40 opportunities daily (20 * 2), real-time
- **Enterprise Group** ($299/month): Unlimited opportunities, custom features
