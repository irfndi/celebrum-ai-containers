# Opportunity Service Specification

## Overview
`OpportunityService` detects arbitrage opportunities based on funding rates and trading fees across multiple exchanges. The service implements secure data sourcing architecture with super admin read-only APIs for global opportunity generation and fair distribution limits, which are now fully implemented and tested.

## Configuration
`OpportunityServiceConfig`:
- `exchangeService: ExchangeService` – external service for fetching rates/fees via super admin read-only APIs.
- `telegramService: TelegramService | null` – optional, sends notifications (private chat only).
- `logger: Logger` – logs info, warnings, errors.
- `monitoredPairs: StructuredTradingPair[]` – list of trading pairs to monitor, derived from the user's configured API key pairs (requires at least two).
- `exchanges: ExchangeId[]` – list of exchange IDs to check.
- `mode: 'manual' | 'auto'` – operation mode for this service instance.
- `autoConfig?: { threshold: number; maxMarginAllocation: number; slippageTolerance: number; }` – parameters for Automated Mode (required if `mode` is `auto`).
- `distributionLimits: FairnessConfig` – opportunity distribution limits (max 2 opportunities, 10 daily, 4-hour cooldown) - **Fully Implemented**.
- `dataSource: 'global' | 'user'` – whether to use global opportunities from super admin APIs or user-provided APIs.

## Data Source Architecture

### Super Admin Read-Only API Configuration (Fully Implemented)
The system implements secure data sourcing for global opportunities:

**Global Data Generation**:
- Super admin provides read-only exchange API keys for market data collection
- ExchangeService consumes only market data (funding rates, trading fees) - NO trading capabilities
- Global opportunities generated from aggregated market data across exchanges
- Complete isolation from individual user trading APIs

**User Trading APIs**:
- Individual users provide their own exchange API keys for personal trading
- User APIs remain completely separate from global data collection
- Manual trading commands use user APIs: `/buy`, `/sell`, `/balance`, `/orders`
- Automated trading (future feature) uses user APIs only

**Risk Isolation**:
- Global opportunity service cannot access user trading functions
- Users cannot access super admin trading capabilities
- Super admin uses separate trading-enabled APIs for personal automated trading
- Clear separation ensures no cross-contamination of trading authority

### Distribution Limits Architecture (Fully Implemented)
Opportunity distribution implements fair access controls:

**Per-User Limits**:
- Maximum 2 opportunities per distribution cycle
- Maximum 10 opportunities per day (24-hour rolling window)
- Minimum 4-hour cooldown between opportunity deliveries
- Limits apply globally across all opportunity types (arbitrage + technical analysis)

**Fair Distribution Queue**:
- Global opportunity pool shared among all eligible users
- Queue-based distribution prevents spam and ensures fairness
- Opportunities distributed based on user subscription tier and activity
- Rate limiting prevents system abuse and ensures stable performance

## Methods

### findOpportunities(
  `exchangeIds: ExchangeId[]`,
  `pairs: TradingPairSymbol[]`,
  `threshold: number` – The minimum **net** rate difference required to consider an opportunity. This is an absolute value representing the decimal form of a funding rate (e.g., `0.0005` represents a 0.05% difference, or 5 basis points). An opportunity is logged if `netRateDifference >= threshold`.
): `Promise<ArbitrageOpportunity[]>`

**Behavior:**
0. Validate that at least two trading pairs are provided (`pairs.length >= 2`); if not, log a warning and return an empty array.
1. Create a list of all unique `(exchangeId, pair)` combinations from the input `exchangeIds` and `pairs`.
2. **Concurrently fetch Data:**
   a. For each `(exchangeId, pair)` combination, fetch **FundingRateInfo** (symbol, fundingRate, timestamp, datetime, info) via `exchangeService.getFundingRate(exchangeId, pair)`.
   b. For each `(exchangeId, pair)` combination, fetch **TradingFees** (containing taker fee rate) via `exchangeService.getTradingFees(exchangeId, pair)`.
   c. Use `Promise.all` to execute these fetches in parallel.
3. **Store Fetched Data:**
   a. Store `FundingRateInfo` in a nested map: `Map<TradingPairSymbol, Map<ExchangeId, FundingRateInfo | null>>`.
   b. Store `TradingFees` in a nested map: `Map<TradingPairSymbol, Map<ExchangeId, TradingFeesInfo | null>>`.
      (Note: `TradingFeesInfo` should be defined or understood to contain at least the `taker` fee rate).
4. **Identify Opportunities:**
   a. Initialize an empty array `opportunities: ArbitrageOpportunity[]`.
   b. For each `pair` in the input `pairs`:
      i. For every unique combination of two distinct exchanges (`exchangeA`, `exchangeB`) from the input `exchangeIds`:
         1. Retrieve `fundingRateInfoA` and `fundingRateInfoB` from the stored funding rate map for the current `pair` and `exchangeA`/`exchangeB`.
         2. Retrieve `tradingFeesA` and `tradingFeesB` from the stored trading fees map for the current `pair` and `exchangeA`/`exchangeB`.
         3. If `fundingRateInfoA` or `fundingRateInfoB` is `null`, continue to the next combination (cannot determine opportunity).
         4. Determine which exchange is `longExchange` (lower funding rate) and `shortExchange` (higher funding rate). Let their respective rates be `longRate` and `shortRate`.
         5. Calculate `rateDifference = Math.abs(shortRate - longRate)`. This value is always positive, representing the gross difference before fees.
         6. Determine `longExchangeTakerFeeRate`: Use taker fee from `tradingFees` of `longExchange` for the `pair`. Default to 0 if fees are unavailable or `taker` field is missing.
         7. Determine `shortExchangeTakerFeeRate`: Use taker fee from `tradingFees` of `shortExchange` for the `pair`. Default to 0 if fees are unavailable or `taker` field is missing.
         8. Calculate `totalEstimatedFees = longExchangeTakerFeeRate + shortExchangeTakerFeeRate`.
         9. Calculate `netRateDifference = rateDifference - totalEstimatedFees`.
         10. If `netRateDifference > 0 && netRateDifference >= threshold`: (A positive net difference exceeding the threshold indicates a potential opportunity)
             - Construct an `ArbitrageOpportunity` object:
               - `pair`: current `pair`
               - `longExchange`: `exchangeId` of the long side
               - `shortExchange`: `exchangeId` of the short side
               - `longRate`: funding rate on `longExchange`
               - `shortRate`: funding rate on `shortExchange`
               - `rateDifference`: calculated gross difference
               - `longExchangeTakerFeeRate`: calculated taker fee for long side
               - `shortExchangeTakerFeeRate`: calculated taker fee for short side
               - `totalEstimatedFees`: sum of taker fees
               - `netRateDifference`: calculated net difference
               - `timestamp`: use timestamp from `FundingRateInfo` of the `longExchange`.
             - Add the new opportunity to the `opportunities` array.
             - Log the found opportunity via `logger.log(...)`.
             - If `telegramService` is configured, asynchronously call `telegramService.sendOpportunityNotification(opportunity)`.
5. Return the `opportunities` array.

**Edge Cases:**
- Skip any exchange/pair if fetching `FundingRateInfo` returns `null`.
- Treat missing fees or missing `taker` fields with caution:
          - **Justification Note:** Most CEX APIs reliably return taker fees. If fee data is truly unavailable for a pair, or if the `taker` field is missing, the exchange might indeed charge 0 for specific promotions or pair types. However, assuming 0 by default can lead to overstated profits and false-positive alerts if actual fees apply.
          - **Safe Handling:**
            - Only default to a taker fee of `0` if the pair is explicitly configured as "fee-free" in the bot's upstream configuration (e.g., based on known exchange promotions or specific account tiers).
            - If fee information is missing and the pair is not marked as "fee-free", the pair should be skipped for opportunity calculation for that exchange to prevent trading based on incomplete or incorrect fee assumptions.

### monitorOpportunities(
  `threshold: number`
): `Promise<ArbitrageOpportunity[]>`

**Behavior:**
1. Retrieve configured `exchanges` and `monitoredPairs`.
2. Map each `StructuredTradingPair` to its `symbol`.
3. Invoke `findOpportunities(exchangeIds, pairs, threshold)`.
4. Log the number of opportunities via `logger.info`.
5. Return the resulting `ArbitrageOpportunity[]`.

### `sendSecureNotification(opportunity: ArbitrageOpportunity, userId: string, chatContext: ChatContext): Promise<boolean>` (Fully Implemented)

**Behavior:**
1. **Context Validation**: Check `chatContext.type` to determine if chat is private or group/channel.
2. **Private Chat Only**: If `chatContext.type === 'private'`, proceed with notification.
3. **Group/Channel Block**: If `chatContext.type` in `['group', 'supergroup', 'channel']`, log warning and return `false` without sending.
4. **Opportunity Formatting**: Format opportunity data for private notification with trading details.
5. **Rate Limit Check**: Verify user hasn't exceeded distribution limits (2 opportunities, 4-hour cooldown, 10 daily).
6. **Secure Delivery**: Send notification via `telegramService.sendPrivateMessage()` with opportunity details.
7. **Tracking**: Update user's opportunity delivery tracking for rate limiting.

**Security Features:**
- **No Group Leakage**: Trading opportunities never sent to groups/channels
- **Context-Aware**: Different message content based on chat context
- **Rate Limited**: Prevents spam and ensures fair distribution
- **Privacy Focused**: Sensitive trading data only in private chats

## Usage Example
```ts
const config: OpportunityServiceConfig = {
  exchangeService,
  telegramService,
  logger,
  monitoredPairs: [{ symbol: 'BTC/USDT', base: 'BTC', quote: 'USDT' }],
  exchanges: ['binance','bybit'],
};
const svc = new OpportunityService(config);
const ops = await svc.findOpportunities(['binance','bybit'], ['BTC/USDT'], 0.0005);
console.log(ops);

// Alternatively, using monitorOpportunities:
const monitoredOps = await svc.monitorOpportunities(0.0005);
console.log(monitoredOps);
