## User Experience & Trading Focus Design

### 🎯 **Trading Focus Selection (User Profile Creation)**

**Primary User Choices**:
1. **Arbitrage Focus** (Default) - Low-risk, cross-exchange price differences
2. **Technical Trading Focus** - Technical analysis-based trading opportunities  
3. **Hybrid Focus** - Both arbitrage and technical trading

**User Profile Creation Flow**:
```
1. Basic Registration (email, trading password (session based when interaction with telegram bot), invitation code)
2. Trading Experience Assessment (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
3. 🎯 TRADING FOCUS SELECTION ← NEW UX STEP
   - "What type of trading interests you most?"
   - Arbitrage (DEFAULT - recommended for beginners, lower risk)
   - Technical Analysis Trading (higher potential, higher risk)
   - Both (for experienced traders)
4. 🤖 AUTOMATION PREFERENCES ← NEW UX STEP  
   - Manual execution (DEFAULT - alerts only) - All users start here
   - Automated execution preferences (premium feature):
     * Arbitrage automation only
     * Technical trading automation only  
     * Full automation (both types)
5. Exchange Connections Setup
6. AI Integration Setup (optional)
7. Final Configuration & Welcome
```

**Data Structure Requirements**:
```rust
// User profile extensions needed
pub struct UserTradingPreferences {
    pub user_id: String,
    pub trading_focus: TradingFocus,        // arbitrage, technical, hybrid
    pub automation_level: AutomationLevel,  // manual, semi_auto, full_auto
    pub automation_scope: AutomationScope,  // arbitrage_only, technical_only, both
    pub experience_level: ExperienceLevel,  // beginner, intermediate, advanced
    pub risk_tolerance: RiskTolerance,      // conservative, balanced, aggressive
    pub created_at: u64,
    pub updated_at: u64,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum TradingFocus {
    Arbitrage,      // Default - focus on arbitrage opportunities
    Technical,      // Focus on technical analysis trading
    Hybrid,         // Both arbitrage and technical
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum AutomationLevel {
    Manual,         // Alerts only, user executes manually
    SemiAuto,       // Pre-approval required for each trade
    FullAuto,       // Automated execution based on rules
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Serialize, Deserialize)]
pub enum AutomationScope {
    ArbitrageOnly,  // Automate arbitrage trades only
    TechnicalOnly,  // Automate technical trades only  
    Both,           // Automate both types
    None,           // No automation (manual only)
}
```

### 🔧 **Settings & Preference Management**

3. **Risk Management** - Risk tolerance and limits  
4. **Notifications** - Alert preferences per trading type
5. **Exchange Management** - Connected exchanges
6. **AI Integration** - AI provider settings

**Access Control Logic**:
```rust
// Determine user access to features based on preferences
pub fn get_user_feature_access(preferences: &UserTradingPreferences) -> FeatureAccess {
    FeatureAccess {
        arbitrage_alerts: true,  // All users get arbitrage alerts
        technical_alerts: preferences.trading_focus != TradingFocus::Arbitrage,
        arbitrage_automation: preferences.automation_level != AutomationLevel::Manual 
            && (preferences.automation_scope == AutomationScope::ArbitrageOnly 
                || preferences.automation_scope == AutomationScope::Both),
        technical_automation: preferences.automation_level != AutomationLevel::Manual
            && (preferences.automation_scope == AutomationScope::TechnicalOnly 
                || preferences.automation_scope == AutomationScope::Both),
        advanced_analytics: preferences.experience_level != ExperienceLevel::Beginner,
    }
}
```

**Default User Settings**:
